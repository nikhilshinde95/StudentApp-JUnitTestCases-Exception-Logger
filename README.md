I created a Student Management Application using Java and Spring Boot. It uses Postgres as the database and Lombok for simplifying code with annotations and additionaly, i add devtools dependancy.
Devtools dependancy help us to when we do some changes in existing project we need not to restart the project manually. Devtools automatically start the project.
Postman handles API calls.
The project includes JUnit test cases for testing, logging for debugging, and exception handling for better reliability.

Features :

      1] View a list of student.

      2] View Student With ID.
      
      3] Add new student to the database.
      
      4] Update existing student information.
      
      5] Delete student from the database.

Technologies Used :

      1] Core Java
        
      2] Spring Boot
      
      3] Postgres
      
      4] Lombok
